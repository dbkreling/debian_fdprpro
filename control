Description: IBM(R) Feedback Directed Program Restructuring
 IBM(R) FDPR is a feedback-based post-link optimization tool. It optimizes
 the executable image of a program by collecting information on the behavior
 of the program while the program is used for some typical workload, and
 then creating a new version of the program that is optimized for that workload.
